# Challenge 2: Professional Portfolio

This project was made with the purpose of demonstrating the following:
- CSS flexboxes
- Media queries
- CSS variables
- CSS pseudo selectors
- CSS positioning
- Responsive layouts

These were demonstrated by building a portfolio page that showcases a few of my projects. The page was built from scratch.

The finished page can be seen at:
